                            Lesson 5
			   Chapter 10

	

	o The telData.txt file is attached and the fields
        are:

|<last name>|<first name>|<emp number>|<hourly wage>|<city>|
   <state>|<area code>|<telephone number>

(Note: The above is all on one line. The pipe symbol is a fairly common delimiter, but in perl regular expressions it also has special meaning
so it will need to be escaped.)

1.  In an if control structure the block of code following the 
    if is only executed when the conditional expression is ______.


	true 

   
2.  Write an expression using the Ternary operator that will return
    the larger of two integer variables $intOne and $intTwo and 
    assign it to $largestNumber.


       $largestNumber = ($intOne > $intTwo) ? $intOne : $intTwo;


3.  List two short circuit operators and give one example, not
    from the book, for each operator.

	
	Two very helpful short circuit operators are the logical
        "AND" (&&) and the logical "OR" (||).

	Example:

		if ($Anthony > 99 && $Anthony > $Average_Bear)
			print "Hey, Boo-boo! Perl is awesome!";

		if ($Vista < $FreeBSD || $Vista < MacOS_X)
			print "Stop trying to re-invent the wheel Bill!";

 
4.  Write a short perl script, q4.pl, that prints out the first name and
    last name of each employee in the telData.txt file whose employee
    number is greater than 200.

Technical constraints:

	  o Use the "use strict;" pragma
	  o Use meaningful names for variable names.
	  o Use the unless control structure to determine
            which lines to print.
	     
	SEE q4.pl

5.  Write a short perl script, q5.pl, that will prompt the user to 
    enter a last name and will search the telData.txt file until the
    first instance of that name is encountered. The script will then
    print the line containing that last name.

Technical constraints:

	  o Use the "use strict;" pragma
	  o Use the until control structure
	  o Use meaningful names for variable names
    
       SEE q5.pl


6.  Write a short perl script, q6.pl, that will print out the 
    first name, last name, and wage for each employee in the
    telData.txt file that makes more than $25 per hour.

Technical constraints:

	  o Use the "use strict;" pragma
	  o Use expression modifiers to print the
	    the lines.


	SEE q6.pl

7.  Describe the differences between the last, next and redo
    operators.

	The "last" operator is used when you want to break out
        of the innermost loop. You might use this after 
        executing a line of code that meets a certain condition or
        makes continuation of the loop pointless or undesireable.

	The "next" operator might be used in a situation similar
        to where the "last" operator would, except that instead of
        terminating the loop, the next iteration of the loop occurs.
        
	The "redo" operator is similar to the "next" operator, but
        it dose not advance the loop to its next iteration. Instead,
        it behaves like instant replay. It runs the body of the loop
        again, without re-testing any control expression for the loop.


8. Write a short perl script, q8.pl, that will print the first name,
   last name, and employee number for employees in the telData.txt
   file whose state is AZ and whose employee number is greater 
   than 200, or whose area code is 703.


   Technical constraints:

   o Use the "Use strict pragma"
   o Use a single if test and logical && and || operators
     to determine which lines to print.
 	
	SEE q8.pl

   Hints:

   o Use a loop and do one line at a time.
   o Split each line so you can use each of the individual
     fields in the if test.
   o Read the wording of the problem carefully to determine
     where to use the && and || operators.
   o Don't hesitate to use ( ) for grouping if it makes it
     easier for you to understand.
