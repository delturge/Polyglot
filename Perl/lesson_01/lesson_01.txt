                       Lesson 1 Chapters 1 & 2


1.  What does Perl stand for?

      Perl stands for the Practical Extraction and Report Language.


2.  What is the difference between single quoted and double
    quoted strings?
 
      Perl interprets the contents of single quoted strings literally,
      providing exceptions for printing single quotation marks (\') and 
      backslashes (\\). Double quoted strings allow for variable 
      subsitution which. In this way, double quoted strings are more
      flexible.
 
3.  How are statements terminated in Perl?

      In Perl, statements are terminated with semicolons.


4.  What is scalar data?

      Scalar data is an instance of a particular data type. Scalar
      data can be manipulated, stored in variables, and can be
      read and written, to and from, various sources.

5.  How do you get a single quote into a single quoted string? Show an
    example.

       For a single quote to appear within a single quoted string, you
       must use a backslash (escape sequence).

          print 'Printing a single quote \'';

6.  What does the line: "chomp($a = <STDIN>)" do?

       In order of precedence:

          1. Requests data from the standard input
          2. Assigns that data to the scalar variable $a.
          3. Removes the "invisible" new-line sequence that
             was appended to the data after pressing "enter"
             on the keyboard.

7.  Write a Perl script, called q7.pl, that prompts the user for their name and
    age in years. The program will then print the users name and 
    age age/3 times. (That is the user's age divided by 3)
    
    Constraints:
    
    1. Use only techniques covered in chapters 1 & 2 no looping constructs are required.
    
    
    The following is an example script execution.

    For the input:

   	perl q7.pl
	Name: Gary Seamans
	Age: 32
	The result is:
	Hello Gary Seamans you are 32 years old
	Hello Gary Seamans you are 32 years old
	Hello Gary Seamans you are 32 years old
	Hello Gary Seamans you are 32 years old
	Hello Gary Seamans you are 32 years old
	Hello Gary Seamans you are 32 years old
	Hello Gary Seamans you are 32 years old
	Hello Gary Seamans you are 32 years old
	Hello Gary Seamans you are 32 years old
	Hello Gary Seamans you are 32 years old

      SEE ENCLOSED FILE

8.  -65e24 is a ___________________ literal.  

        FLOATIING POINT

9.  The value -425 is TRUE in Perl. 
  
        TRUE. Zero is the only number that is false.


10. The ______is the string concatenation operator.

        The period (.) is the string concatenation operator.
