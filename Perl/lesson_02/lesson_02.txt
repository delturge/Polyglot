                         Lesson 2
                      Chapters 3 & 4


1.  What is a list ?

	A list is an ordered collection of scalars. Each
        element of a list is a separate scalar variable
        with its own scalar value. Lists can have any
        number of elements (or be empty).

2.  What is an array ?

	An array is a variable that contains a list. The
	elements of an array are indexed by sequential integers
        starting at zero. An array may have any number of 
	elements (or have no elements).

  
3.  How do you represent the empty list ?

	An empty list is represented by opening and closing
        parenthesis with nothing between them ().

4.  Assign the values "one", "two" and "three" to the variables
    a, b, and c using a single statement.

        I tried this many times with Perl 5.8.8 in FreeBSD 6.1
        and it does not work. Then I downloaded and installed
        perl from the class web site, and it worked in WinXP.

	($a, $b, $c) = qw (one two three);

5.  How would you print the following sentence using the 'fruitList'
    list from question #6?

    The list of fruit is: appleorangepearpeachgrape.

    print "The list of fruit is: " @fruitList;

6.  Show the command that will assign the words, "apple", "orange",
    "pear", "peach", and "grape" to a list called 'fruitList'.

        I tried this many times with Perl 5.8.8 in FreeBSD 6.1
        and it does not work. Then I downloaded and installed
        perl from the class web site, and it worked in WinXP.

	  @fruitList = qw< apple orange pear peach grape >;

7.  Swap the values of variables a and c from question #4 using
    a single statement.

	  ($a, $c) = ($c, $a);

8.  Write a Perl script that reads in a list of strings on separate
    lines, from <STDIN>, sorts the list, and then prints the list in 
    sorted order and in reverse sorted order.

	  SEE q8.pl

9.  How would you access the third element of an array called "myArray"?

          $myArray[3];

10. How would you assign a slice of the array "myArray" consisting of
    the 3rd through 5th elements to the array "mySlice"?

          @mySlice = @myArray[3..5];

11.  Write a Perl script called q11.pl that:
    
    o Prompts the user to enter two negative numbers.

    o Prints an error message if either of the two 
      numbers is greater than -1

    o Calculates and prints the sum of the two numbers.

    
    
    Technical constraints:
    
    o Use the "strict" pragma

    o Use a subroutine that calculates and 
      returns the sum of the two numbers.

    o Pass both of the numbers input by the
      user to the subroutine as parameters.

    o Use the return value from the subroutine
      call to print the sum of the numbers.

          SEE q11.pl

12. What is @_ , what does it contain, and when is it used?

	  The character combination, @_, is a special array 
          variable whichs holds the parameter list of a
          subroutine. Subroutines access this array to determine
          the number of argument that have been passed to it,
          and the values of those arguments.

13.  Write a Perl script called q13.pl that:

    o Prompts the user to enter a number between 3 and 11
      inclusive or "quit" to quit. The user will be
      re-prompted after each entry unless they enter "quit".
    o Prints: "<num> is out of range" if the user enters a
      a number outside of the range 3-11.
    o Prints: "<num> is in range" if the user enters a
      number in the range.

    Technical constraints:

    o Use the "strict" pragma

    o Use a while loop to keep the program going until the user
      enters "quit".
    o Use an if/else statement to print the in/out of range messages.

    Hints:

    o Review table 2-2 on page 32.
    o Review table 2-3 on page 33, let me know if you have any questions.
    o Don't forget that when you read something in from <STDIN> it
      still contains a newline, '\n', character at the end.
    o Read the "do_while.html" under "Course Documents"

          SEE q13.pl

14.  Repeat question 13, call it q14.pl, except using a do/while loop.

          SEE q14.pl

15.  Create an array containing the numbers 5 - 15 using the push operator. Print the array using the shift operator, the pop operator, and a foreach loop.

    Technical constraints:
    
    o Use separate subroutines to create the array and for each of the
      print requirements.

    Hints: 
     o You will need to use a temporary variable to hold the array or you may 
       need to recreate the array after printing with the shift/pop operators.

     o Here is a program that will create an array and print its contents using
     for loops:

         SEE q15.pl
