                  Lesson 3 Chapters 5 & 6 

	o This assignment covers chapters 5 & 6 

1.  Should you depend on the order of element in a hash? Why?

	A developer creating programs with Perl, that contains
	hashes, should not depend on the order of elements. Perl
	does not place restrictions on the size or number of 
        elements in a hash. In order to preserve efficiency, Perl
	stores the elements by use of an algorithm that provides
        fast access.

2.  Show the command to create a hash, passwords, containing the
    key/value pairs: 
    "barney/llama betty/camel wilma/llama fred/alpaca"
    Use a single statement.

	%passwords = qw{
			barney llama 
			betty camel 
			wilma llama 
			fred alpaca
		      };

3.  What command would you use to print out the value "camel"
    using the passwords hash from question #2?

	print $passwords{betty};

4.  What commands would you use to print out all of the keys
    from the passwords hash from question #2?
    The printout should look similar to the one below:
    The key list for passwords: fred barney betty wilma


	(@passwords_keys = (keys %passwords));
	print "The key list for passwords: @passwords_keys";    


5.  What commands would you use to print out all of the values
    from the passwords hash from question #2?
    The print out should be similar to the one below:
    The value list for passwords: llama camel llama alpaca

    
	(@passwords_values = (values %passwords));
	print "The value list for passwords: @passwords_values";


6.  What command would you use to delete the key/value pair
    fred/alpaca from the passwords hash from question #2?

	delete $passwords{"fred"};


7.  What command would you use to add the key/value pair
    red/apple to the passwords hash from question #2?

	$passwords{"red"} = "apple";

    ##### The following questions require techniques from 
    #####  both chapter 5 and 6 to answer.



8.  Write a perl script called q8.pl that reads strings from
    standard input, maps them to the password hash, and prints
    out the hash value in the passwords hash or 
    "<word> is not in the passwords hash". A sample run follows:

    q8.pl 
    fred
    "fred" maps to "camel" in the passwords hash.
    bob
    bob is not in the passwords hash.
    wilma
    "wilma" maps to "llama" in the passwords hash.
    ^Z

    (Note: The above was run on Windows, to end the input on
    UNIX/Linux use <ctrl>-d).

    Technical constraints:

    o Use a while loop to keep the program going until the user
      enters a <ctrl>-Z or <ctrl>-d, Windows/Linux.

    o Use an if/else statement to print the messages.

    Hints:

    o Look at the while loop on the top of page 89.
    o Review the answer to exercise 1 from chapter 5.
    o Don't forget that when you read something in from <STDIN> it
      still contains a newline, '\n', character at the end.
           
            SEE q8.pl

9.    Show the commands to write an if/else statement that will print "Key
       found." If the the key "barney" exists in the hash from
       question #2 or "Key not found." if  the key "barney" does not
       exist in the hash from question #2. 

	SEE q9.pl

10. Write a perl script, q10.pl, that reads in files specified
    on the command line, places each line from the files into
    an array, and prints out the total lines read and then
    each line read. A sample run follows:
    
    q10.pl something.secret
    Total lines in the files: 8.
    fred
    camel
    barney
    llama
    betty
    alpaca
    wilma
    alpaca

     Technical constraints:

     o Your printout should look like the above.
     o Place each line from the file into the array
       individually after removing the newline.
     
     Hints:

     o You could use the push function while reading in the
       files to populate the array.
     o Don't forget that in a scalar context an array returns
       the number of elements.
     o Review the examples on page 89 and the exercise
       answers before attempting this script.
